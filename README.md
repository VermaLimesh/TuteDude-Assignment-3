## The README includes:
- Clear descriptions of both tasks
- Example outputs

## file 1: Calculate_Factorial.py
  This program:
    1. Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
    2. Returns the calculated factorial.
    3. Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

    
  Example output:
    Enter a Number: 5
    The factorial of 5 is 120
    

## file 2: Calculations_With_Math_Module.py
  This program:
    1. Asks the user for a number as input.
    2. Uses the math module to calculate the:
        o   Square root of the number
        o   Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
        o   Sine of the number (in radians)
    3. Displays the calculated results.

  Example output:
    Enter a number: 25
    Square root:  5.0
    Logarithm:  3.2188758248682006
    Sine:  -0.13235175009777303
